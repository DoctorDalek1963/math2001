# Math 2001

This project is a stripped-down copy of [Heather Macbeth's math2001 course](https://github.com/hrmacbeth/math2001) and the associated book, [The Mechanics of Proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001).

### Quickstart

Activate the flake with `direnv allow` then `nix-direnv-reload` or just `nix develop`, then run `lake build`. Make sure your Lean environment runs the LSP with `lake serve` (which `lean.nvim` does by default).
